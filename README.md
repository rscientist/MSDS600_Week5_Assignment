This is my Week 5 Assignment for MSDS600. Rafael Fernandes

In this repository are all the necessary files to open and run my assignment. 
To complete this assignment I'm using automatically ML pycaret to execute and run all my code. 
After I set up a virtual environment that I called 'pyca' I'm comparing, exploring, potting the best model.

I hope everybody enjoy my work and give me suggestions to improve it!

Rafael.
